Hangman
This is a simple Hangman game implemented in Python. In this game, the player needs to guess the correct word within a limited number of attempts. For each incorrect guess, a part of the stick figure is drawn. If the stick figure is completely drawn before the player guesses the word, the game is lost. Otherwise, the player wins by guessing the word correctly.

Instructions
  Run the play(word) function to start the game.
  Enter a letter or a word to make a guess.
  Keep guessing until you either guess the word correctly or the stick figure is fully drawn.
  You have a maximum of 8 attempts to guess the word.

Have fun playing Hangman!
